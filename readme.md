# Mask

## Problems

Validation of what the mask should actually do. It depends on the key that's pressed, how many digits are currently there, etc. Thinking of corner cases could be a useful excercise to increase the functionality.

When deleting a non digit, if a digit is immediately entered a special character will not be entered.
